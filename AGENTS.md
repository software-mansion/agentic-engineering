# Software Mansion Agentic Engineering Guide

## Rules

- you may be running in parallel with other agents; cooperate to avoid conflicts, but avoid committing changes made by others
- in markdown, try to put each sentence on a separate line
- `<ExternalLink>` component is whitespace sensitive; when reformatting make sure it stays within flowing text inline:

  ```md
  # Good

  Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,
  consectetur <ExternalLink href="https://example.com">adipiscing elit</ExternalLink>.

  # Bad

  Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur
  <ExternalLink href="https://example.com">adipiscing elit</ExternalLink>
  .
  ```

- run `bun lint` to format code and run linters (including `astro check`); there are no tests
- ignore any backward compatibility - break stuff everywhere if needed
- assume `Astro.site` is always defined in `astro.config.ts`; do not add defensive fallbacks or runtime guards for it
